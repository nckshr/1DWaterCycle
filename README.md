# 1DWaterCycle
A python implementation of the 1D shallow water equation with rain drops that slowly fill the sim. Once the water level reaches a certain height, the water is drained back down to a starting level and the cycle repeats.

#Installation
- after dependencies are installed, this code can be run simply by calling ```python water1D.py```

#Dependencies
- This code requires numpy. To install, use ```pip install numpy```
- The rendering part of the code uses [graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py), an object-oriented python graphics lirbray from John Zelle. The graphics.py file is already included
